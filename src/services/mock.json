Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . \"Production hell\" is part of Tesla lore. CEO Elon Musk has even joked about it. When the carmaker first showcased the Model 3 in 2017, I asked him to talk about production hell and how much of it he was about to face. The answer was \"at least six months.\" But he was quick to note that the then-upcoming Model 3 production hell would be less hellish than the hells the company endured with its previous three vehicles, the original Roadster, the Model S sedan, and the Model X SUV. As it turned out, his welcome levity did nothing to mitigate a much more severe Model 3 production hell, which was ultimately the production hell to end all production hells.",

        "summary": "Across the African continent, First Ladies are generally considered the ‘Mother of the Nation’, and are often expected to be unifying figures, serving the president of the nation and the voters who entrusted him the mandate to lead. While the position of first lady is not legally or constitutionally provided for in many countries, many presidencies cater for the Office of the First Lady, through which the holder is facilitated to champion social causes. The Organisation of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD), created in 2002, brings together First Ladies of Africa ‘to advocate for policies that make health services accessible and laws that boost women and youth empowerment’. OAFLAD is currently led by First Lady of Burkina Faso, Adjoavi Sika Kabore, who is deputised by her Kenyan counterpart Margaret Kenyatta. A first lady by definition is the wife of the head of state, and it therefore follows that most African nations led by a male president, have a first lady. SUGGESTED READING: Celebrating African First Ladies In this article, we will share updates from the continent’s First Ladies as they take on different roles to complement their government’s policies.",

Visit BGR’s homepage for more stories . PlayStation 5 news has been incredibly hard to come by in recent months. The last official word we got directly from Sony was a post on the PlayStation Blog in which the company talked about the new controller for the PS5, which we expect to be called DualShock 5. That was October of 2019. It is now a week into March of 2020, and while Microsoft has given us a lot to chew on in regards to the Xbox Series X, we still know next to nothing about the PS5. Therefore, even vague quotes from third-party developers are enough to make headlines. Speaking of which, in the April issue of the Official PlayStation Magazine UK ( via PSU ), Luca Dalco, head of an Italian game studio called LKA, was surprisingly forthcoming about the power of the next-gen console: PS5’s specifications are incredibly exciting – particularly for us is the additional graphical power and inclusion of ray-tracing architecture.",

A software patch will not suffice to permanently fix the problem. Instead, an upgrade to a next-gen Intel chip and an audit of existing hardware are advised. This kind of vulnerability can be likened with a backdoor in encryption . Visit BGR’s homepage for more stories . Intelligence agencies and the tech sector have been debating encryption for a few years now. Spy agencies and cops want to be able to break encryption with the help of big tech companies to access sensitive data from devices belonging to suspects. At the same time, some of them fear hacks, especially those coming from other nation-states, and agree that encryption is needed both at the hardware and software level. But officials from several governments around the world would want secret keys that can access encrypted chats, emails, and calls. And they’d want those keys to be safe to handle.",

SXSW typically draws well over 100,000 people from around the world, and up until today, the organizers had planned to keep the event going despite multiple companies pulling out. Apple was planning to debut new Apple TV + content at SXSW, but earlier this week said that it would no longer attend. Other companies that include Amazon Studios, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Panasonic, SAP, HBO, and Intel had all declined to attend because of COVID-19 fears.

It is the largest most powerful ARM chip to date for cloud computing that matches the performances of traditional x86 chips by Intel and AMD while using far less power, James tells Business Insider. Microsoft and Oracle, two companies close with James, have already signed on to use the chip in their clouds. This could help them compete with Amazon's cloud. Amazon bought its own ARM chip maker and is using that chip in its own AWS cloud. Today \"Intel has 98% + share\" in the data center server market but ARM chips is the next big thing, James tells Business Insider. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Earlier this week, Ampere, the chip startup founded two years ago by former top Intel exec Renee James, stunned the industry by releasing a powerful new ARM processor for cloud computing data centers. It's the first time a chip based on the energy-efficient ARM technology has been able to go toe-to-toe in terms of raw computing performance with the top-of-the line x86 chips made by Intel and AMD, the chips which currently dominate the data center market. \"We started this company two years ago and in two short years, we've come out with a product in cloud that's a breakthrough,\" James told Business Insider.",

General Motors is good at building cars, but the company has never used its manufacturing power as a weapon in the electric-car market. That's about to change, as GM launches 22 new electric vehicles by 2023. Tesla needs to rapidly overcome its manufacturing weaknesses. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . \"Production hell\" is part of Tesla lore. CEO Elon Musk has even joked about it. When the carmaker first showcased the Model 3 in 2017, I asked him to talk about production hell and how much of it he was about to face. The answer was \"at least six months.\" But he was quick to note that the then-upcoming Model 3 production hell would be less hellish than the hells the company endured with its previous three vehicles, the original Roadster, the Model S sedan, and the Model X SUV. As it turned out, his welcome levity did nothing to mitigate a much more severe Model 3 production hell, which was ultimately the production hell to end all production hells.",

That went into overdrive this week after the Federal Reserve announced a surprise, emergency cut to its benchmark interest rate in the face of the growing global coronavirus outbreak. Following the rate cut, JPMorgan Chase's call centers and digital channels were flooded with mortgage-related inquiries, leading the bank this week to dial back its marketing spend. In contrast, Bank of America isn't shifting home-equity staff — because it extensively trained hundreds of them on mortgage underwriting in 2019 to give the bank more flexibility. Experts say rates heightened demand will continue as rates fall further, and that could mean long wait times to close on homes and refinancings. Visit BI Prime for more stories . Mortgage rates were already hitting record lows — and then the Federal Reserve unleashed an emergency cut to its benchmark interest rate.",
