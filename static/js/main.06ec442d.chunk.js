While the position of first lady is not legally or constitutionally provided for in many countries, many presidencies cater for the Office of the First Lady, through which the holder is facilitated to champion social causes. The Organisation of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD), created in 2002, brings together First Ladies of Africa \u2018to advocate for policies that make health services accessible and laws that boost women and youth empowerment\u2019. OAFLAD is currently led by First Lady of Burkina Faso, Adjoavi Sika Kabore, who is deputised by her Kenyan counterpart Margaret Kenyatta.

The last official word we got directly from Sony was a post on the PlayStation Blog in which the company talked about the new controller for the PS5, which we expect to be called DualShock 5. That was October of 2019. It is now a week into March of 2020, and while Microsoft has given us a lot to chew on in regards to the Xbox Series X, we still know next to nothing about the PS5. Therefore, even vague quotes from third-party developers are enough to make headlines. Speaking of which, in the April issue of the Official PlayStation Magazine UK ( via PSU ), Luca Dalco, head of an Italian game studio called LKA, was surprisingly forthcoming about the power of the next-gen console: PS5\u2019s specifications are incredibly exciting \u2013 particularly for us is the additional graphical power and inclusion of ray-tracing architecture.","related":"MSFT","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/233bd1f0-bbc9-492c-91cb-87744b328632","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1583535311000,"headline":"Apple advises 12K workers to stay home as coronavirus \u2018precaution\u2019","source":"New York Post","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/16546c56-1f13-4c07-8d4f-a17f2b97fa63","summary":"Apple is encouraging all employees at its headquarters to work from home to combat the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 joining other tech giants like Microsoft and Google.

released in the last five years contain a severe hardware security flaw that would allow hackers to bypass encryption. A software patch will not suffice to permanently fix the problem. Instead, an upgrade to a next-gen Intel chip and an audit of existing hardware are advised. This kind of vulnerability can be likened with a backdoor in encryption . Visit BGR\u2019s homepage for more stories . Intelligence agencies and the tech sector have been debating encryption for a few years now. Spy agencies and cops want to be able to break encryption with the help of big tech companies to access sensitive data from devices belonging to suspects. At the same time, some of them fear hacks, especially those coming from other nation-states, and agree that encryption is needed both at the hardware and software level. But officials from several governments around the world would want secret keys that can access encrypted chats, emails, and calls.

It is the largest most powerful ARM chip to date for cloud computing that matches the performances of traditional x86 chips by Intel and AMD while using far less power, James tells Business Insider. Microsoft and Oracle, two companies close with James, have already signed on to use the chip in their clouds. This could help them compete with Amazon\'s cloud. Amazon bought its own ARM chip maker and is using that chip in its own AWS cloud. Today \\"Intel has 98% + share\\" in the data center server market but ARM chips is the next big thing, James tells Business Insider. Visit Business Insider\'s homepage for more stories . Earlier this week, Ampere, the chip startup founded two years ago by former top Intel exec Renee James, stunned the industry by releasing a powerful new ARM processor for cloud computing data centers. It\'s the first time a chip based on the energy-efficient ARM technology has been able to go toe-to-toe in terms of raw computing performance with the top-of-the line x86 chips made by Intel and AMD, the chips which currently dominate the data center market. \\"We started this company two years ago and in two short years, we\'ve come out with a product in cloud that\'s a breakthrough,\\" James

Amid falling interest rates, mortgage volumes have been soaring since the second half of 2019. That went into overdrive this week after the Federal Reserve announced a surprise, emergency cut to its benchmark interest rate in the face of the growing global coronavirus outbreak. Following the rate cut, JPMorgan Chase\'s call centers and digital channels were flooded with mortgage-related inquiries, leading the bank this week to dial back its marketing spend. In contrast, Bank of America isn\'t shifting home-equity staff \u2014 because it extensively trained hundreds of them on mortgage underwriting in 2019 to give the bank more flexibility. Experts say rates heightened demand will continue as rates fall further, and that could mean long wait times to close on homes and refinancings. Visit BI Prime for more stories .
